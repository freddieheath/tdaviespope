  Teaming up with Bristol collective ‘Lost Track of Time’ to create interactive and immersive decor for their largest show to date at Motion in Bristol, with Ross from Friends and Maribou State headlining and 2,300 party-goers.
  
  A 21m² canopy designed, built and hung in the ‘Old Marble Factory’ in order to define the dance floor in a large and busy space. Roughly 1000 Loops of 100% recycled, painted grey-board that took inspiration from the balance of analogue and digital in Ross from Friends music.
  
  An arrangement of three 800mm cubes that offered a dynamic method of showing set times, as well as a branded photo opportunity near the main bar. Building and designing the cubes, whilst working collaboratively with Dylan Tan to design the projection mapped visuals.`,

    This project started out as a short video in response to the ‘Note to Self’ brief put out by Glimpse. The project acted as a reminder to our future self to stick to our values, particularly in regards to the environment, that are tested as we enter the professional world.

    After being shortlisted from roughly 200 entries, we developed the work into an installation where sandcastles displaying commandment style messages of common environmental values. The sandcastles represented a reminder of our youth when values are often prioritised, yet are fragile under the pressure of professional life. Visitors were encouraged to build and crush their own sandcastles whilst visiting the exhibition.

    A final major project installation, designed for Boomtown’s Chapter 3. Encouraging altruism and respect for the environment, through a giant intergalactic seed landing from outer space. Using interactive technologies to unknowingly create a positive experience for those within the seed from the outside, highlighting the altruistic nature of the work upon reflection of the experience. Supported by a ‘Daily Rag’ article that I screen printed 250 copies of to distribute at the UAL Design Show 2024.

    A speculative, self-initiated project created in response to Boomtown’s Chapter 3 theme: ‘Revolution of Imagination’.
    
    The walls are lined with an array of chaotic blank cassettes that visitors can write on. As the festival progresses the walls will be filled with messages and writing from people claiming the blank cassettes to be their own albums.
    
    The design features a bingo roller on the entrance, operated by actors within the festival who turn the wheel and pull out bingo balls for festival-goers to gain entry. The interior intends to resemble being within a giant bingo roller.`,

    A second self-initiated project for Boomtown, inspired by a trip to Marrakech. A small, hidden stage that focuses on Middle-Eastern inspired music with DJs such as Toumba, Moktar and Nabihah Iqbal on the line-up.
    
    A stage within Letsbe Avenue that is inspired by the common imaginary scenario of “imagine if we won the lottery”. Highlighting the winning feeling of listening to your favourite DJ, dancing with friends and being lost in the moment.
